# SQL

This project used data from Rockbuster, a movie rental company, to identify trends in the data as well as answer the shareholder's questions. The dataset was accessed using SQL, and contained information on Rockbuster's customers, their inventory, the revenue made, etc. Using SQL, we were able to answer crucial client information such as, "what movie sold the most?" and "what genre generated the most revenue".
